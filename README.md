# Building_Linear_Regression_Models_Based_On_The_World_Happiness_Report
This project involves data wrangling, exploratory analysis, linear regression models, and data visualization. In this project, I analyze the 2019 *World Happiness Report* (version 2). Specifically, I look at the relationships between several variables including *GDP per capita*, *healthy life expectancy*, *freedom to make life choices*, and *perceptions of corruption*. My analysis produces several surprising results.
